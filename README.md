# Ringtone randomizer
----------
* This application is developed in 2011~2012 (when I was learning in university) and renewed at 2015
* The renewed codes are based on codes from 2011, so quality is not that really good actually :-p
* This code does not guarantee that it will work for newer version of Android (API 23 over)
* Also, there are some phones which is not supported (the phones that does not use Android API for calling and ringing system)
